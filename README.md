# Gratitude

I extend my deepest gratitude to the following individuals and resources for their invaluable contributions to this project:

* **ClearCode**: For generously providing the CustomTkinter template, which serves as the bedrock of this application. The insightful tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mop6g-c5HEY).

* **Tuaplicacionpropia**: For crafting the main algorithm that serves as the backbone of our image slicing functionality. The implementation details can be explored [here](https://gist.github.com/tuaplicacionpropia/f5bd6b0f69a11141767387eb789f5093).

* **Cainos**: For graciously offering the pixel art showcased in the video demonstration below. Cainos's creative work can be accessed [here](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic).

* All the dedicated developers and contributors behind the libraries utilized in this application. Their unwavering commitment and hard work have been instrumental in shaping this project.

# Instructions for using Auto Detection:
- Min Width, Min Height: Specify the minimum size of a rectangle; any objects smaller than this will merge with another object.
- Alpha Threshold: Pixels with an alpha value lower than this threshold are considered part of the background.
- Number of Cores: Adjust the number of CPU cores utilized for processing images; increase for faster processing with large images.
- Background Color: Current background color.
- Choose Color: Use this button to select a single pixel in the image as the background color.
- Detect: Initiate object detection.
- Merge: Select objects by dragging or clicking; press Enter to merge them.
- Delete: Similar to Merge, but deletes selected objects.
- Add: Independently select objects; press Enter to confirm.
